Tutorials start the week of January 13, 2024.     \n",
      " \n",
      "2 Each tutorial group is assigned a TA who will lead your discussions and be available to you for oﬃce hours and by email. Your TA should be your primary point of contact for any ques/ons about this course.  Grading Scheme  Assignment 1: Introductory paragraph, including thesis statement – 12.5% Due January 26, 2025 @ 11:59PM EST via Quercus  Assignment 2: Using evidence to make a persuasive argument – 12.5% Due February 16, 2025 @ 11:59PM EST via Quercus  Short essay (5 pages) – 25% Due March 16, 2025 @ 11:59PM EST via Quercus  Final Exam – 35% Online, during exam period  Par/cipa/on – 15% Your par>cipa>on grade is evaluated by your TA, based on tutorial aNendance, ac>ve engagement in class discussion, and evidence that you have aNended the lecture and completed the readings for the week.   Late policy Late assignments will be penalized at a rate of 1% per day and will not be accepted aZer 7 days from the due date. Please pay careful aNen>on when submi\\ng assignments to Quercus as only certain ﬁle types are accepted and unreadable ﬁles will be marked as late.   Extension policy Extension requests should be made to your TA before the assignment is due. Extensions will be no more than one week (7 days). If you are a student registered with UofT’s Accessibility Services, kindly note that you must also request an extension before the assignment is due and that the extension cannot be more than one week.  Grade Appeals All course assignments are graded using a set of rubrics and scoring guides. This ensures that assignments are graded fairly, consistently, and objec>vely. If you believe that there was an error in the grading process, then you have the right to request a regrade of your assignment. To be considered for a regrade, you must wait at least 48 hours from receiving your assignment before submi\\ng a wriNen request for a regrade. Your wriNen regrade request should be sent to the Teaching Assistant assigned to you. Your request for a regrade must be raised within ten (10) days from the 48-hour wai>ng period. Regrade requests submi\\ed a]er this ten-day window has passed will not be considered.   \n",
      " \n",
      "3 The request for a regrade needs to be grounded in academic ra>onale and must be accompanied by clear reasoning for why a regrade is being requested. As such, it is expected that you will provide evidence in support of your regrade. This evidence must come from the course materials such as lecture notes, readings, and grading rubric.    It is also important to note that the reassessment of an assignment does not guarantee an increase in your grade. The assignment could receive a higher grade, the same grade, or a lower grade.  Plagiarism Chea>ng and plagiarism are serious academic oﬀences. University policy requires that course instructors refer suspected plagiarism cases to the Oﬃce of Academic Integrity for resolu>on. For further clariﬁca>on and informa>on, please see the University of Toronto’s policy on plagiarism at hNp://www.wri>ng.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize.   “Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University’s plagiarism detec>on tool for a review of textual similarity and detec>on of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detec>ng plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innova>on web site (hNps://uoZ.me/pdt-faq).”  Use of Genera/ve AI “You may use ar>ﬁcial intelligence tools, including genera>ve AI, in this course as learning aids. If you choose to use ar/ﬁcial intelligence tools, you must submit, as an appendix with your assignment(s), a 150–200-word reﬂec/on on how you made use of genera/ve ar/ﬁcial intelligence tools in the development of the assignment(s). Your reﬂec>on must include what tools you used, how you used them, and how you incorporated the results from the AI into your assignment. In addi>on, any content produced by an ar/ﬁcial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately (view the U of T Libraries Cita>on Guide for Ar>ﬁcial Intelligence Genera>ve Tools). Finally, the course instructor and TAs reserve the right to ask students to explain their process for crea>ng their assignment.”  Accessibility Services The university is fully commiNed to providing students with fair access to their courses. Students with special needs or disabili>es are strongly encouraged to register with Accessibility Services to arrange for needed accommoda>ons.

This course, \\nIntroduction to Computer Science,\\n introduces you to how computer scientists think in a systematic way about computing. Our goal is to provide you with skills for approaching program design in a principled way, using techniques such as encapsulation, modularity, information-hiding, comparing different implementations for efficiency, and building powerful data structures.\\n\\n\\nThe material posted on Quercus is required reading. You are responsible for all announcements made on Quercus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Information\\n\\n\\nTextbook\\n\\n\\nLectures\\n\\n\\nGetting Help\\n\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\n\\nCourse Software\\n\\n\\nMarking Scheme\\n\\n\\nAssignments\\n\\n\\nLabs\\n\\n\\nSpecial Consideration\\n\\n\\nAcademic Integrity\\n\\n\\nAccessibility Needs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJonathan Calver is the Course Coordinator, which means that he and the Instructional Support staff deal with all administrative aspects of the course.

Be prepared to get your gears turning in class! There is very strong evidence that active learning is more effective than passively listening to a lecture — and it tends to be a lot more fun!\\n\\n\\nRecordings\\n\\n\\nSome sections will be recorded and available to everyone through the OCCS Student App. Details will be provided once finalized.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nViewing the recorded materials may provide a poorer learning experience than participating actively in class. If you are unable to attend a lecture, we encourage you to consider attending another section or finding a group of students to work through the active learning activities with outside of lecture time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting Help\\n\\n\\nDiscussion Board: for sharable questions\\n\\n\\nPlease post your questions about the course material and assignments on our Piazza discussion board so that everyone can benefit from your questions and answers. \\nHelping someone else learn is one of the most effective ways of deeply learning a subject.\\n\\n\\nWe will monitor the discussion board regularly, but it may take longer to get answers near due dates, so try to start assignments early in case you have questions. Answers to frequently asked questions will be posted on Piazza throughout the term as we identify them.\\n\\n\\nGroup Office Hours: for sharable questions\\n\\n\\nGroup Office Hours will be held in person. We will go over concepts and examples based on your requests. You are welcome to bring questions, or just to listen and meet other students.\\n\\n\\none-on-one office hours: for everything\\n\\n\\nThere will be regular office hours held each week, and additional office hours held in the week prior to each assignment due date. These will be a mix of online and in-person. See the office hours calendar for the most up-to-date schedule throughout the term.\\n\\n\\nCourse email account: for personal matters\\n\\n\\nPlease use the course email account (\\ncsc148-2025-01@cs.toronto.edu\\n) for personal matters such as missing course work due to illness. \\nCourse content questions should be directed to piazza or office hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabs\\n\\n\\nAfter lectures each week, you will participate in a two-hour lab, where you will reinforce and extend your learning from lecture that week. \\nThe first labs are the week of January 13th; there are no labs the first week of the course\\n.\\n\\xa0Like lectures, all tutorials start at 10 minutes past the hour. \\nYou must register for a lab section (TUT) on ACORN, separate from your lecture section. \\nYou are allowed to pick any lab time — independent of your lecture time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\n\\nCSC108 or equivalent programming experience is assumed. We\\'ll be using Python in the course, but past experience with other imperative programming languages like Java or C should be fine. There will be a \\n rampup session \\n during the first weekend of term for students whose background is not in Python or who feel they need a refresher. Details will be announced on Quercus closer to the date.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some links to CSC108 materials and general advice:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvice on choosing your first-year courses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks to an external site.\\n (skip down to \"Which introductory course is right for you?\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation about the CSC108 textbook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks to an external site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCSC108 Youtube channel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks to an external site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Coursera course 1 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks to an external site.\\nand \\nCoursera course 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks to an external site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDropping down to CSC108\\n\\n\\nUp until the deadline to add courses on Sunday January 19th, 2025, you may wish to drop down to CSC108 if you find that your prior programming experience is not allowing you to keep up with the content of this course. \\nAfter this date, you can speak to your College Registrar until Thursday January 30th, 2025 to request dropping down to CSC108.\\n Note: this will only be possible provided there is space available in the section of CSC108H1 in which you hope to enrol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourse Software\\n\\n\\nFor information about the software we\\'ll use for this course, please see the \\nSoftware Guide\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssessments and Grading Scheme\\n\\n\\nYou will complete four major kinds of assessments in this course: weekly preparation exercises, labs, assignments, and midterm/final exam. \\nYou will also complete a module on \\nEmbedded Ethics in computing\\n. All assignments will consist of a Quercus quiz (worth 5%), an initial submission (worth 20%), and a final submission (worth 75%). Details will be included in the assignment handouts when they are posted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssessment\\n\\n\\nWeight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 prep exercises\\n\\n\\n8%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1% each; best 8 of 10; due Tuesdays at 8AM\\n\\n\\nPrep 1 is \\nnot\\n for credit, but try to complete it before your first lecture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsetup and debugging activity\\n\\n\\n1%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndue Wednesday January 15 at 5PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8 labs \\n(called \"TUT\" on Acorn)\\n\\n\\n7%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1% each; best 7 of 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment 0\\n\\n\\n5%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninitial submission + Quercus Quiz: Monday January 27 at 6PM\\n\\n\\nfinal submission: Monday February 3 at 6PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMidterm\\n\\n\\n15%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring class time on Tuesday February 11 and Wednesday February 12.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment 1\\n\\n\\n10%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninitial submission + Quercus Quiz: Monday March 3 at 6PM\\n\\n\\nfinal submission: Monday March 10 at 6PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment 2\\n\\n\\n10%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninitial submission + Quercus Quiz: Monday March 24 at 6PM\\n\\n\\nfinal submission: Monday March 31 at 6PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmbedded Ethics Module\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2% total:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 surveys: 0.5% each\\n\\n\\nWritten exercise: 1%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-module survey due \\nTBD\\n\\n\\nWritten exercise due \\nTBD\\n\\n\\nPost-module survey due \\nTBD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal Exam\\n\\n\\n42%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-hour, comprehensive exam during the final assessment period.\\n\\n\\nYou must earn 40% or above on the final exam to pass the course; otherwise, your final course grade will be no higher than 47%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMissed Midterm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are not able to offer a makeup midterm. For a student who misses the midterm, the \\nweight of the midterm will automatically be shifted to the final exam\\n; you do not need to do anything for this re-weight to be applied. If you miss the midterm, we recommend that you attempt a version of the midterm for self-assessment once the midterms and sample solutions are posted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment Policies\\n\\n\\nAssignments must be submitted electronically, using the MarkUs online system. Be sure to confirm that you have submitted all the required files and the correct version of each; we cannot accept missing files or a different version of an already-submitted file after the due date. \\nMake sure to run any provided self-tests on MarkUs to confirm we are able to run your code. If you have never run the self-tests, we will NOT consider any remark requests for the assignment.\\n\\n\\nYou will be given 32 grace tokens on MarkUs. Each token will give you an additional 12 hours to submit an assignment — \\nup to a maximum of 96 hours (4 days) for any given assignment deadline (A0, A1, and A2 only; grace tokens cannot be applied to preps, labs, or the debugging activity)\\n. Grace tokens are automatically applied on MarkUs.\\n\\n\\nIn most exceptional cases, the grace token extension of four days is expected to give you adequate time to complete the assignments.\\xa0\\nWe strongly encourage you to treat the original deadline as the true deadline — only using your grace tokens when necessary.\\n\\n\\nIf you are registered with accessibility services or experience a situation requiring special consideration beyond four days, please complete the special consideration form described below if you require further extensions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Consideration\\n\\n\\nStudents experiencing illness or other emergencies that prevent them from being able to complete homework on time can request special consideration. You will be required to affirm that you are abiding by the \\nCode of Behaviour on Academic Matters\\n, in particular, to be aware that it is an academic offence\\n\\n\\nto engage in any form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not herein otherwise described, in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind\\n\\n\\nThat is, you must be truly experiencing an emergency, and acknowledge that to falsely claim so is an academic offence. Making a request does not guarantee that you will be granted special consideration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Consideration Request Form\\n(link to be added once available)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcademic Integrity\\n\\n\\nAll of the work you submit must be done by you, and your work must not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. The department uses software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and Regulations from the U of T Governing Council (especially the \\nCode of Behaviour on Academic Matters\\n).\\n\\n\\nPlease also see the information for students from the \\nOffice of Student Academic Integrity\\n.\\n\\n\\nPlease don’t copy. We want you to succeed and are here to help. Completing your assigned work is the best way to ensure that you are ready to perform well on the final exam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy on generative AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this course, you may use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT and MS Copilot, as learning aids and to help complete weekly preps, labs, and assignments.\\n\\n\\nYou will not be permitted to use generative AI on the midterm test or final exam. As such, we caution you to not rely on these tools to complete your coursework. Instead, we recommend treating generative AI as a supplementary tool to help you learn the course material. Ultimately, you are responsible for your own learning in this course, and for all the work you submit for credit. It is your responsibility to critically assess your own learning independent of generative AI tools. Overreliance on generative AI may give you a false sense of how much you’ve actually learned, which can lead to poor performance on the midterm test or final exam, in later courses, or in future work or studies after graduation. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccessibility Needs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations or have any accessibility concerns, please visit\\xa0\\nhttp://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as/new-registration\\n as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\nStudents who require accommodations need to register with Test & Exam Services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe syllabus page shows a table-oriented view of the course schedule, and the basics of\\ncourse grading.  You can add any other comments, notes, or thoughts you have about the course\\nstructure, course policies or anything else.\\n\\n\\nTo add some comments, click the \"Edit\" link at the top.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSyllabus Description:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShow Course Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nUpdate Syllabus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8199334a-45ca-416c-8dd7-1ecf5c930ba7'"
